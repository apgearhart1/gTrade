Bug List

1) If you are on the the homescreen of our web app and you type out enough of the company name to the point that
   there is only one option left in the drop down, then you will not be able to select that item to get analysis
   on it.
2) When running our web app on google chrome there is a CORS error when Data.js makes its http request. To fix this
   one must open their google chrom in disabled web security mode.
3) On the web app, if you select 'Submit' but you have not selected a stock yet our app lets you go to the next page
   even though there should be an error.
